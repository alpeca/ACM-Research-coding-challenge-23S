# Star Dataset Report
## How Data Was Broken Down
At first I subset the data by star type, making each star type its own 
data frame. However, I soon realized I had no use for this for the type of
analytics I was planning to do with this dataset.

Secondly, I mapped the axes of which variables I wanted to compare. While
comparing the distribution of star types, it was discovered each type
evenly appeared throughout the dataset. Each star type was just as common
as each other.

I am not well-versed in typing in markdown, so I am unable to insert my 
graphs at the moment, but I partially reconstructed the diagram shown in 
the Kaggle description with each star type color coded.
